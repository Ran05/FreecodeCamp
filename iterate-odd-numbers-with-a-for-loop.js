/**
Basic JavaScript: Iterate 
Odd Numbers With a For Loop
For loops don't have to iterate 
one at a time. By changing our 
final-expression, we can count by even numbers.

We'll start at i = 0 and loop while i < 10. We'll increment i by 2 each loop with i += 2.
 */

// Setup
var myArray = [];


//var myArray = [];
for (var i = 1; i < 10; i += 2) {
  myArray.push(i);
}



// Only change code below this line
